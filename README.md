Scope and sequence
E-Shopping List
This program is aimed to help the costumers managing and tracking the items in their shopping list. It lists all the items with name, decription and price you add in, and at the same time, allows you to edit or remove the items if you want. It also lets you print the list out. The program helps you keep track of what you want to buy and make sure you don't overrun a budget. It's simple, convenient and easy to use, try it now!
Features:
The GUI of the software will have a 960 * 540-pixel-sized window, wich contains 5 bottoms on the top of the windo
1."add item" buttom which adds items with their name, price and description in the table;
2."Edit" which helps editing information of items; 
3."List" which helps list out all the items added in; 
4."Remove" which removes item in a list;
5."Print" which let the costumer print out their lists. Beneath the bottoms, there will be a text box listing all of the items added in.
  
-Designing the whole window will spend us 2 hr （Including where to put each of the bottoms, windows popping out when there's something wrong & all the windows the user can use to edit their items in the list.）
-Editing the content of the windows spends us 2 hr.
-Coding functions for each bottom and windows spendsus 20 minute for each. 
-Checking and talking about these functions & their improvements spends us 2 days. (In this case, we consider one day as 3 hours.)
-Debugging spends us 3 days.

If we have more time, I believe that we will add the function of letting the users set their budget. If the total price of the stuffs is higher than the budget, an warning appears.
